# This Terraform script for HCP/OSS Boundary sets up a new fully-privileged user with a new password auth method.
# A user must be associated with an account, which belongs to an auth method. For a user to have full permissions
# at each scope level, the user must be added to a role in each scope. 
#
# Prerequisites: The Boundary cluster must be deployed.
# Note: This script is only for learning purposes and is not recommended for a production deployment
