# Boundary Reference Architectures
This repo contains community-supported examples for deploying Boundary on different platforms - including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose. Most examples use Terraform for provisioning and configuring Boundary.

Disclaimer: the examples in this repository are for demonstration purposes only to convey how to get Boundary up and running
on popular cloud and container platforms. They're not officially supported modules or designed to be "production" ready. They're
here as a starting point and assume end-users have experience with each example platform.
